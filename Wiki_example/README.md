In this folder we reproduce the example of elctrochemistry in Elmer Wiki:
http://www.elmerfem.org/elmerwiki/index.php?title=Electrochemistry

This example contains three cases of transport and we've added a first simpler case. 
The different cases depend on the difference of some magnitudes between the boundaries anode and the cathode.
